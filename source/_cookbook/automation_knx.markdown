This cookbook shows a general KNX set up and communication with other systems like the Philips Hue.

## {% linkable_title General KNX setup %}

``` yaml
knx:
  # This is all you need to get the KNX component up and running.
  # Auto config works nicely and usually no config data for your KNX ip tunnel is needed. 
  # If the KNX router is not found automatically, check the docs and add the IP config here.

# get some sensor data from KNX to HA
sensor:
  - platform: knx
    name: Helligkeit Treppe oben
    address: '6/1/0'
    type: 'illuminance'
    # The entity_id of this sensor will be generated from the name by a slug function.
    # In this case, it will be sensor.helligkeit_treppe_oben
    # See dev tools' state page (icons at the bottom of left side menu) for a list of all entity_ids

light:
  # See "sensor" remarks above for an explanation of the resulting entity_ids
  - platform: knx
    # switched light
    name: 'Eltern Decke'
    address: '1/2/10'
    state_address: '1/2/11'
    
  - platform: knx

    name: 'Eltern Bett'

    state_address: '1/2/15'
    brightness_address: '1/2/13'
    brightness_state_address: '1/2/16' 

cover:
  # KNX Covers are roller shutters and blinds.
  # These items currently expose a bug with the invert_position setting:
  # Either you will get 100% for an open shutter and 0% for a closed one
  # or you will get the function of up and down arrows exchanged wrongly.
  # Hope this is resolved soon.

## {% linkable_title Basic KNX automation %}

This example uses an automation that is activated by a KNX switch.

The automation then triggers a script that controls a KNX light and dims it down in 5 steps from 80% to 0% over a time span of 5 minutes.

Care must be taken to stop the script, when the light is otherwise switched (i.e., by its normal on/off KNX switch). If we don't do that, the light will first switch correctly, but then the script will continue to run in the background and after the next delay has passed it will kick in again and activate its next dim level.

```yaml
knx: 

switch:
- platform: knx
  # The normal on/off switch for the light
  name: "Licht, Eltern Bett"
  address: '1/2/12'
- platform: knx
  # The switch that triggers the dim script
  # This switch must be configured in ETS to send on when pressed and off when released
  name: "Licht, Eltern Bett, Fadeout"
  address: '1/2/17'

light:
  # This is the light that we want to dim (more precisely it is the dimming actuator of the light).
  # It is directly controlled through the first switch above.
  # (Note that the switch shares its group address with this light and thus controls it over the KNX bus.)
  - platform: knx
    name: 'Eltern Bett'
    address: '1/2/12'
    state_address: '1/2/15'
    brightness_address: '1/2/13'
    brightness_state_address: '1/2/16' 

automation:
# start the dim script, if the dim switch is pressed
- id: light_eltern_bett_fadeout
  alias: Licht Eltern Bett Fade-Out
  trigger:
  - entity_id: switch.licht_eltern_bett_fadeout

    entity_id: script.light_eltern_bett_fadeout

  condition: []
