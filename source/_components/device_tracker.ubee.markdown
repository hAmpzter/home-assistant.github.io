This platform offers presence detection by looking at connected devices to a [Ubee Router](http://www.ubeeinteractive.com/products).

To use a Ubee router in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
device_tracker:
  - platform: ubee
    host: ROUTER_IP_ADDRESS
    username: YOUR_ADMIN_USERNAME
    password: YOUR_ADMIN_PASSWORD
```

{% configuration %}
host:
  description: The IP address of your router, e.g., `192.168.1.1`.
  required: true
  type: string
username:
  description: The username of a user with administrative privileges, usually `admin`.
  required: true
  type: string
password:
  description: The password for your given admin account.
  required: true
  type: string
{% endconfiguration %}

By default, Home Assistant pulls information about connected devices from Ubee router every 5 seconds.
See the [device tracker component page](/components/device_tracker/) for instructions on how to configure the people to be tracked.
