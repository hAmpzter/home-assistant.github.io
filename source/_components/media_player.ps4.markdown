The `ps4` component allows you to control a
[Sony PlayStation 4 console](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/explore/ps4/).

- This component supports controlling a single PlayStation 4 for your instance. Additional consoles may be supported in a future release.

## {% linkable_title Requirements %}

- Android or iOS device
- PS4 Second Screen App for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.playstation.mobile2ndscreen&hl=en_US) or [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ps4-second-screen/id1201372796?mt=8) installed on device.

## {% linkable_title Set up %}

1. Download the Second Screen App and make sure that you can find and control your PlayStation 4 normally.

<p class='note'>
  Read the section "Granting Port Access" below before continuing.
</p>

2. Navigate to `Configuration -> Integrations` and select `Configure` for `PlayStation 4`.

3. Follow instructions displayed to generate user credentials. You will know this step is completed when a form with fields appears.

4. Pair Home Assistant to your PlayStation 4 by filling in the fields.
- **Note:** To find your correct region refer to the section [Regions](#regions)

## {% linkable_title Granting Port Access %}

The PlayStation 4 component requires the use of privileged ports to work correctly, specifically UDP port 987 and TCP port 997. Depending on your OS of your Home Assistant instance you may need to allow usage of privileged ports manually.
Home Assistant installed on a Debian-type OS for example, such as *Debian*, *Hassbian*, *Rassbian*, and *Armbian* may require configuration.

<p class='note warning'>
  Do not run your <b>Home Assistant</b> instance itself as <b>root</b> or with <b>root/sudo privileges</b> to accomplish this. This would create a security risk for your host system.
</p>

There are varying methods to perform this, dependent on your OS that is running Home Assistant. Specifically, your *Python Interpreter* which runs your Home Assistant instance needs access to the mentioned ports.

<p class='note'>
  If your Home Assistant device is running <b>Hass.io</b> on <b>HassOS</b>, it does not require additional configuration.
</p>

- Example for Debian:
`sudo setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' /usr/bin/python3.5`
Replace "/usr/bin/python3.5" with your path to Python that is running Home Assistant.

### {% linkable_title Docker %}

When running Home Assistant using Docker, make sure that the Home Assistant container is discoverable by the PS4. This can be achieved by ensuring that the Home Assistant container uses the `host` network driver (by passing `--net=host` to the container when creating, or adding `network_mode: "host"` to your compose file when using `docker-compose`).

## {% linkable_title Configuration %}

<p class='note'>
  The PlayStation 4 component does not use entries from `configuration.yaml`. You must configure this component by using `Integrations`
</p>

## {% linkable_title Regions %}

Some titles will have different SKUs in the PlayStation Store database depending on your region. You must select your specific region in the setup in order to retrieve the cover art for such titles correctly. If you do not know your [region](https://www.gamerbraves.com/ps4-games-region-codes-explained/), reference the table below:
