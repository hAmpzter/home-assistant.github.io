The System Health component provides an API to offer information on the system and its components. It also allows to run diagnostic tools to diagnose problems.

Add the following to your configuration.yaml file.
```yaml
system_health:
```

Once added the system health component data can be viewed in the developer tools under <img src='/images/screenshots/developer-tool-about-icon.png' alt='service developer tool icon' class="no-shadow" height="38">.
